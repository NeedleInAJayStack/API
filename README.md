# API

This is Jay's API for different datasets that he has.

## Getting Started

Create a `.env` file in this directory that contains necessary environment variables. For example:

```
DATABASE_HOST=<host>
DATABASE_USERNAME=<username>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password>
DATABASE_NAME=<name>
```

## Future work

- Secure the API against unauthorized actors (doesn't have to be complex or even configurable - user/password could even be environment variables)
- Add web-app to easily input data values
- Change to GraphQL?
- Consider aligning timestamp format (ISO8601 vs epoch)
